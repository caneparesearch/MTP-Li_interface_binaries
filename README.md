# MTP-Li_interface_binaries

This repository contains the moment tensor potentials of heterogenous interfaces of alkali metal with binary compounds, such as LiS2, Li3P, Li3N. 
These results are discussed in the manuscript with title "The Resistive Nature of Decomposing Interfaces of Solid Electrolytes with Alkali Metal Electrodes"
by J. Wang, A. A. Panchal, G. Sai Gautam, P. Canepa. A preprint of the manuscript is available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01264 .
